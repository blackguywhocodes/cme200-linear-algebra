% Problem 1
\begin{homeworkProblem}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Basis for column space of a matrix $A$. There are 2 ways to find this. 
\begin{itemize}  
  \item Perform GE on $A$ to get an upper-triangular matrix $U$. Then the basis of column space of $A$ is formed by the columns of ORIGINAL MATRIX $A$ that correspond to the columns with pivots of $U$. Many of you took the columns with the pivots from matrix $U$ which is wrong. 
  \item Perform GE on $A^T$ to get an upper-triangular matrix $U_1$. Then the basis of column space of $A$ is formed by the rows with pivots of $U_1$.
\end{itemize}

\item For this problem, when you get matrix $B$, you have to make sure that $B$ has rank 3. This is because if rank of $B$ is less than $3$, then the null space of $B$ will be strictly larger than the row space of $A$. And if rank of $B$ is larger than $3$, then the null space of $B$ is strictly less than row space of $A$. The problem asks you to find $B$ whose null space is IDENTICAL to row space of $A$. \\ \\
For example
\[ B = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -2 & 1 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \]
Note that rank of $B$ is 2. The null space of $B$ is spanned by 
\[ \left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}, 
\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\right\} \]
This is not identical to row space to $A$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{homeworkProblem}

% Problem 2
\begin{homeworkProblem}
For this problem, you have to show that the conditions on $m, n, r$ that you claim are both {\it sufficient} and {\it necessary} conditions. \\ \\
In order to show that condition $a$ is a {\it sufficient} condition for statement $p$ to be true, you must show that condition $a$ implies statement $p$ ($a \implies p$). \\ \\
In order to show that condition $a$ is a {\it necessary} condition for statement $p$ to be true, you must show that statement $p$ implies condition $a$ ($p \implies a$).
\end{homeworkProblem}

% Problem 5
\begin{homeworkProblem}[Problem 5]
This is a general comment on proving statement $p$ implies statement $q$ ($p \implies q$). There are many ways to do this. However, one thing that is wrong is starting with assume $q$ is true. \\ \\
For example, problem 5 asks you to show that if $V$ and $W$ are 3 dimensional subspaces of $\R^5$, then $V$ and $W$ have a nonzero vector in common. In this case, $p$ is the statement: ``$V$ and $W$ are 3 dimensional subspaces of $\R^5$''. And $q$ is the statement: ``$V$ and $W$ have a nonzero vector in common''. I found that some people start with $q$ is true and try to show that $p$ is true, that is, start with ``suppose $V$ and $W$ have a nonzero vector in common'', and try to show that ``$V$ and $W$ are 3 dimensional subspaces of $\R^5$''. This is not correct.
