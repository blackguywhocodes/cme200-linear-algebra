\begin{document}
\maketitle
\thispagestyle{fancy}
\textbf{Important:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Give complete answers: Do not only give mathematical formulae, but explain what you are doing. Conversely, do not leave out critical intermediate steps in mathematical derivations.
\item Write your \textbf{name} as well as your \textbf{Sunet ID} on your assignment. \textbf{Please staple pages together.} Points will be docked otherwise.
\item Questions preceded by  $\star$  are harder and/or more involved.
\end{itemize}


% Problem 1
\begin{homeworkProblem}
True or False? Motivate your answers clearly.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
%(10)
\item For a non-singular $n \x n$ matrix $A$, the {\it Jacobi} method for solving $A\vec{x} = \vec{b}$ will always converge to the correct solution, if it converges.

 %(10)
\item  The {\it Gauss-Seidel} iteration used for solving $A\vec{x} = \vec{b}$ will always converge for any $n \x n$ invertible matrix $A$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{homeworkProblem}

% Problem 2
\begin{homeworkProblem} 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
%(10)
\item Find an invertible $2 \x 2$ matrix for which the {\it Jacobi} method does not converge. Please find a matrix not already shown in class or the workshop.

 %(10)
\item  Find an invertible $10 \x 10$ non-diagonal matrix for which the {\it Jacobi} method converges very quickly. Please find a matrix not already shown in class or the workshop.
\end{enumerate}
\end{homeworkProblem}
  
  
% Problem 3
\begin{homeworkProblem} 
In this assignment, we'll be making much use of the 1-norm. We define the 1-norm of a vector $\vec{x}$ as $\|\vec{x}\|_1 = \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i|$, i.e. the sum of the magnitudes of the entries. The 1-norm of an $m \x n$ matrix $A$ is defined as $\|A\|_1 = \max_{1 \leq j \leq n} \sum_{i=1}^n |a_{ij}|$, i.e. the largest column sum. It can be shown that for these norms, $\|A \vec{x}\|_1 \leq \|A\|_1\|\vec{x}\|_1$ (we will not prove this here, but you can use it as given, whenever needed). Compute the 1-norm of the following matrices and vectors

\begin{enumerate}[(a)] %(5 each)
\item $\vec{x} = (1, 2, 3, \ldots, n)^T$.
\item $\vec{x} = \left(\frac{1}{n}, \frac{1}{n}, \frac{1}{n}, \ldots, \frac{1}{n} \right)^T$.
\item $\alpha I$ where $I$ is the $n \x n$ identity matrix.
\item $J-I$ where $J$ is the $n \x n$ matrix filled with 1s and $I$ is the $n \x n$ identity.  
\end{enumerate}
\end{homeworkProblem}
  

% Problem 4
\begin{homeworkProblem} 
In the workshop, we will discuss page rank computations. The linear system is of the form $(I - \alpha P) \vec{x} = \vec{v}$. Here $\alpha$ is the fraction of a page's rank that it propagates to neighbors at each step and each entry in $\vec{v}$ is the amount of rank we give to each page initially. For this problem, we set $\alpha = 0.85$, and all elements $v_i$ of the vector $\vec{v}$ equal to $v_i = 1/n$, where $n$ is the number of total pages in the internet domain we are investigating. The matrices $I$ and $P$ are $n \x n$ matrices. For this problem (and also in general) we do not allow pages to link to themselves. Thus the diagonal elements of the matrix $P$ are all $0$. 

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
%(10)
\item As we will prove in a later part of this problem, the matrix $I - \alpha P$ is invertible, so a unique solution to the pagerank system exists. We'll try to find this solution using the Jacobi iteration. Give the algorithm for the Jacobi iteration for the page rank equation. 

%(15)
\item Lets assume the answer is the vector $\vec{x}^*$. Analyze the distance between $\vec{x}^*$ and successive iterates of the Jacobi iteration, that is, find the relationship between $\|\vec{x}^{(k+1)} - \vec{x}^*\|_1$ and $\|\vec{x}^{(k)} - \vec{x}^*\|_1$. Note that we measure distance in terms of the 1-norm here. Your analysis must hold for any $n \x n$ page rank matrix $P$. Form your analysis, show that $\alpha$ must be chosen to be smaller than $1$. \\
(Hint: first compute the 1-norm of $P$.) 

%(15)
\item Now, show that the matrix $I - \alpha P$ is invertible for any $n \x n$ page rank matrix $P$. \\
(Hint: don't forget that we have $0 < \alpha < 1$.)
\end{enumerate}
